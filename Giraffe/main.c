/* NOTES - Drawing shapes C Lesson
- Build and run option for both at the same time
- When we write a program we have a set of instructions
- When executed correctly result in the computer doing something for us.
- ; to end instructions
- Looks at main and then the other instructions
- Instructions for computer to carry out
- Complexity determines what the program does.

- Make it easier to make changes to text so that you don't have

- a console story application
- Think of placeholders so that you don't have to keep typing out the variable
- That way you only have to verify in one spot
- Can then modify variable halfway though the story
